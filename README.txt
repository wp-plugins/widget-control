Widget Control helps you keep more Control of your Widgets. (Early version has limited options, see description!)

== Description ==

Widget Control is a plugin which aims to add more advanced control over your Widgets. At the moment the only feature 
it has is the ability to disable all Widgets at the same time. I hope to get some time and ideas to add more features
in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I've only tested the plugin with WP 2.7.0 and 2.7.1, but it will probobly work in older version as well. Let me know!<br/>

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'widget-control.php' file into it's own 'widget-control' folder and put it into your wp-content/plugins/ directory (wp-content/plugins/widget-control/widget-control.php).

== Features ==

* Deactivate all widgets with one button click <em>(useful when upgrading WP)</em>
